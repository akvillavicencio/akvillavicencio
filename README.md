# Hello, I am Antonio

He/him

I program as a hobby sometimes. \
This is a business account, my personal account contains a lot more work. \
I primarily use C, C++, Rust, etc, but I've been looking to branch out into Javascript, Typescript, and web stuff. \
I am experinced in Cybersecurity, and am Security+ certified. \
I'd be willing to take commissions for programming projects, and deployment on the cheap, as well as free advice. \
If interested, contact me at akvillavicencio938@gmail.com.

I support the use of FOSS, primarily use GPLv3, LGPLv3, or MIT licenses for the most part.
